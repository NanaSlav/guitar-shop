                Our guitar shop is very good. You can choose the guitar you like.  I buy only from Gibson, Taylor and Rickenbacker.  So you will find the equipment you need at our shop." Matthew Schultz
                The wood for this model is hard wood.  Hard wood is preferred to be used on a Gibson guitar because of its smooth and consistent sound. Wood is placed in the "glue" or filler of a guitar.  When the glue dries and hardens the wood becomes one piece.  In modern guitars, hard wood is added to the top of the neck area to give a variety of colors.  This ensures that the instrument is easily recognizable.  Therefore, hard wood is not used on modern guitars.  Here are

            <h3>Some words about our shop:</h3>
            Some words about our guitar shop.  Mike and I ran an Irish Bar Guitar shop in the western section of town for 25 years.  It was a proud moment when we finally broke through the wall of fear and prejudice by entering the Cork Piano Show in 1997 and being awarded the best and most competitive entry and without any publicity.

We hope to continue our career in a staff job with the skill to help you start or grow your business.  Mike can explain it all, but we

            <h3>How to choose the guitar</h3>
            Choose guitar carefully. It should be absolutely comfortable to you. Pick a sweet sounding guitar. Listen to it in a gig or in the room. Then choose a classic amp and head and get to it.

            Now for your learning. First, tune the guitar. Don't play on some little finger fret. Tune it every string using the sixth fret (the one you normally hit with a thumb). If you mess up on that, go play it again and make sure you get it right. You need to know how to hit each string so you can use this as the anchor string.


            Also, play it out loud for an hour or so. Every now and then, try to add some licks in. This will help you be a better
